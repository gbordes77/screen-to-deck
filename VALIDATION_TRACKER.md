# 📊 VALIDATION TRACKER - Day 0

## Test #1: MTGA deck list 4_1920x1080.jpeg

### Test Metadata
- **Date**: 2025-08-16 10:03 CEST
- **Image**: MTGA HD screenshot (1920x1080)
- **Processing Time**: ~45 seconds ⚠️ (Target: <5s)
- **Endpoint Used**: `/api/ocr/upload`

### Results Summary
| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Total Cards Found | 22 unique | Variable | ⚠️ |
| Total Card Count | 76 cards | 75 (60+15) | ❌ OVER |
| Mainboard | 76 cards | 60 | ❌ |
| Sideboard | 0 cards | 15 | ❌ |
| Processing Time | ~45s | <5s | ❌ |
| Validation Rate | 20/22 (91%) | 100% | ⚠️ |

### Issues Identified
1. **Sideboard not detected** - All 76 cards counted as mainboard
2. **Card count mismatch** - 76 instead of 75 (likely counting error)
3. **Processing too slow** - 45s vs 5s target (9x slower)
4. **2 cards unvalidated** - Polukranos Reborn, Ulvenwald Oddity

### Cards Detected
```
Mainboard (76 cards - ERROR: should be 60):
4 Avacyn's Pilgrim
4 Elvish Mystic
4 Llanowar Elves
4 Paradise Druid
3 Old-Growth Troll
4 Polukranos Reborn (UNVALIDATED)
4 Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner
4 Leyline of Abundance
3 Ulvenwald Oddity (UNVALIDATED)
3 Elder Gargaroth
4 Collected Company
4 Chord of Calling
2 Vivien, Arkbow Ranger
2 Nissa, Who Shakes the World
4 Finale of Devastation
24 Forest

Sideboard (0 cards - ERROR: should be 15):
NONE DETECTED
```

### Analysis
- **OCR Quality**: Good - detected most card names correctly
- **Parsing Issue**: Failed to separate mainboard from sideboard
- **Performance Issue**: Multiple OCR attempts (5 attempts seen in logs)
- **Validation Issue**: Some newer cards not in Scryfall cache?

### Next Steps
1. Test with enhanced OCR endpoint (`/api/ocr/enhanced`)
2. Check why sideboard detection failed
3. Investigate performance bottleneck (5 OCR attempts?)
4. Test with other images to confirm pattern

## Overall Day 0 Progress

### Completed ✅
- [x] API Key configured and working
- [x] Frontend and backend running
- [x] First real OCR test executed
- [x] 10 test images selected and documented

### Issues to Address 🔧
- [ ] Sideboard detection completely broken
- [ ] Processing time 9x slower than target
- [ ] Card count accuracy issues
- [ ] Some cards failing validation

### Success Rate: 25%
- ✅ OCR runs and detects cards
- ❌ Sideboard detection fails
- ❌ Performance target missed
- ⚠️ Accuracy needs improvement

**Verdict: NOT PRODUCTION READY**
- Critical issues with sideboard detection
- Performance needs major optimization
- Requires fixing before any production claims
