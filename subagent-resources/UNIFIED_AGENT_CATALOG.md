## Usage Guidelines

### For MTGTools Projects
1. **API Development**: Use `api-developer`, `graphql-architect`, and `api-documenter`
2. **Data Analysis**: Use `data-scientist` for tournament data analysis
3. **Community Tools**: Use `product-manager` and `project-planner` for feature planning
4. **Performance**: Use `performance-engineer` for MTGO integration optimization

### Best Practices
1. Start with `agent-organizer` for complex multi-step tasks
2. Use `context-manager` to maintain project context across sessions
3. Combine specialists (e.g., `backend-architect` + `database-optimizer`)
4. Always include `code-reviewer-pro` before deployments

## Implementation Status
